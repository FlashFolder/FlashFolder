Generic:

[ ] DPI-Scaling for toolbar icons

[ ] Test if iTunes is still incompatible
[ ] autostart fails if terminal services are not running
	-> start FF via Run regkey?
[ ] specify log file path per commandline, otherwise create no log file (for running from external drive, etc.)
[ ] Favmenu editor: use shell folder icon
[ ] Optionally save last folder even on Cancel
[x] Fix "remember view mode" for Vista
[x] 64-bit: control panel, hooks (service can stay 32-bit?)

-----
Security:

[ ] check if FlashFolder toolbar window exists - deny termination of hook process then
	-> blocks installation, need at least a user message
[ ] Restrict services privileges under Vista
[ ] Use private namespaces for kernel objects under Vista ( http://www.codeguru.com/columns/kate/article.php/c13249 )
[ ] RemoveHook(), FinalizeService() - wait until Hook processes are actually terminated (with timeout)

-----
Cosmetic:

[ ] Use Vista-style file dialogs in FFConfig (do not use CFileDialog)
[ ] Use Vista-style treeview, listview, link controls
