FlashFolder is an extension for file-related common dialogs (e.g. open/save dialog) 
seen in most Windows programs. A small toolbar docks onto these dialogs that provides
menus for quick access to recently-used folders, favorite folders and more.

FlashFolder also enhances the file dialogs by other means:
- enlarges the dialogs to a configurable size (even non-resizable file dialogs 
  of many programs)
- can automatically position the dialogs at the center of the main program window 
  or at the center of the screen
- enlarges the directory- and file type drop-down fields so less scrolling is needed for them 
- Total Commander (R) directory menu can be displayed instead of FlashFolders 
  own favorites

Supported dialogs:
- common open/save dialog (Win 2000 / XP)
- MS Office open/save dialog (requires Win XP for full functionality)
- common browse for folder dialog (Win 2000 / XP)
- "open with" dialog (Win 2000)

The "open with" dialog is an exception in that it does not host the FlashFolder
toolbar. FlashFolder only enlarges this dialog (even makes it resizable) and 
repositions it according to what is set in the options dialog.
