News for project FlashFolder
============================

v1.7.76 beta

This is only a minor release. The visual quality of the toolbar icons is enhanced - they now use Truecolor including alpha channel (WinXP) and should be more distinguishable than the old ones.
FlashFolder can also check for updates now (function located in the options menu, only manually for now).

This release fixes bugs, provides a workaround for iTunes incompatibility and features a reworked options dialog. Also notable is the new auto-complete functionality for the path edit control of the FlashFolder toolbar.

v1.7.26 beta

This is mainly a bug-fix release. 
Most importantly FlashFolder now works better with the MS Office file open/save dialogs: The current directory is now displayed correctly, the "view all files" button works and the directory of the opened file is added to the history menu.
